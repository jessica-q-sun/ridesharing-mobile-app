# A Cross-Platform Mobile Ridesharing App
 A cross-platform ridesharing app that allows users to sign in, select origin and destination, and choose a car type. 

* Built the app UI with React Native and implemented navigation between screens, header bars, and tab bars using React Navigation
* Utilized AWS Amplify as backend and connected the app with GraphQL to provide user authentication and realtime database services, including location tracking and data storage of GPS coordinates
* Implemented Google Map APIs to render map and draw routes and to enable autocomplete for the location input
